# Welcome to my Brainteasers repository!
#### This is where I solve interview-prep questions and write tests for them using Jest
---
## To test my solutions: 
1. `git clone sshlink <directory_name>`
2. `cd <directory_name>`
3. run `npm`
4. run `npm test` to see all tests run or npm test Javascript/tests/<file to test>.test.js

All files have a link to the original brainteaser on codewars or leetcode, if you want to see the full prompt
